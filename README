This project is done by Christian Pedersen and Vincent Tofterup in relation to a 
Bachelor project for SDU.

The aim is to build a solution for a drone to avoid collision with beams and bars in a
greenhouse environment.


Compiling on Raspberry Pi may need the following command to set up the virtual environment: 
~/CVB16_Drone_collision_avoidance$ workon cv


This branch is for the colision avoidance system in terms of computer vision. This is
implemented as collision risk methods in the feature_detection class. 

Three modes are considered: half_speed, full_stop and feedback. 

Look in hpp and cpp files for more information.
