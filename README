This project is done by Christian Pedersen and Vincent Tofterup in relation to their 
Bachelor thesis for SDU.

The aim for this project is to build a system for a drone to avoid collision with beams and bars in a
greenhouse environment.


This branch is for the colision avoidance system in terms of computer vision and flight manipulation. This is
implemented as collision risk methods in the feature_detection class. 

Three modes are considered: half_speed, frontal_block and echo.
